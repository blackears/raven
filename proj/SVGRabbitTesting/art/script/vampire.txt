EXT. VILLAGE OF REDTHORN - DAY

SHEPHERDS are in the meadow, tending their flocks.  In the distance smoke curls from the rooves of Redthorn village.  Arounbd the village you can see preparations for the midsummer moon festival.

		*TITLE
	Redthorn Village



EXT. SHEEP BARN - DAY

JOEL, a young goat-man, loads bales of raw wool onto a cart outside his uncle ALAN's shearing barn.

		ALAN
	You'd better not be slacking off.
	
		JOEL
		(Grunts)
	I'm almost done, uncle.
	
		ALAN
	When I was you age, I could'a had this packed and on the way to Dairy an hour ago.
	
		JOEL
	Yeah, well, you're not my age.  That's why you're spending your time playing cards at the pub.
	
		ALAN
	Oh-ho!  I'd suggest you spend more time flexing your back and less time flexing that tongue o'yours.
	
		JOEL
	Ha!  Be careful what you wish for.  When I get down to that pub you'll not have another winning hand 'til the barkeep tosses you out on your sorry ear.
	
		ALAN
	My, what a smart lad you are.  A mind like that would be better put to tallyin' the bolts of cloth down at Mary's shop.
	
JOEL hands JOEL a blank inventory sheet.

		JOAH
	Ah!  Uncle!
	
		ALAN
	Now quit yer belly-achin'.  And mind you keep your eyes on the job and not that young lass o' hers you've been mooning over.
	
JOEL takes manifest, ALAN leaves.  JOEL continues loading  the last few bales of wool.



INT. MARY'S WEAVER SHOP - DAY

MARY, a middle-aged goat, bustles behind the counter.  In the back of the shop GWEN can be seen weaving.  JOEL enters, carrying a bale of wool.

		JOEL
	Mornin' Mary.  I've got your next week's work here for you.
	
		MARY
	Well, bless you, Joal.  We were starting to run low.
	
		JOEL
	Alan tells me you need a hand countin' up your inventory.
	
		MARY
	Aye.  All the new cloth is in the back.  Gwen has been weavin' up a storm since ye last came.
	
JOEL walks to back of store.  GWEN, a young female goat, sits before a loom.  She stops and looks at JOEL as he enters.

		GWEN
	Joal!
	
		JOEL
	Gwen!  Has that old wolf got you captive again?
	
		GWEN
	Joal!  Don't say such things!
	
		JOEL
		(laughs)
	I kid.  Mary's almost as kind as you are.
	
		GWEN
	Oh Joel.
	
		JOEL
	Ha Ha.  I hear that you've been weaving like a spider lately.
	
		GWEN
	Hmm?  Oh yes.  There it is, all stacked against the wall.
	
JOEL walks over to the rows of bolts of cloth and starts counting.  One resting against a corner in the room catches his eye.

		JOEL
	What's this then?
	
		GWEN
	Oh, do you like it?  I've been working on that one specially.
	
JOEL unrolls cloth and examines it.  A beautiful image of a stag in the forest has been woven into its fibres.

		JOEL
	It's amazing.  How did you do it?
	
		GWEN
	If you reverse the loom, you can change the texture of the fabric.  The first time I did it it was an accident, but then when I though about it, I realized that I could use it to make a picture.
	
		JOEL
	You sure are clever.
	
		GWEN
	I'd like to try again.  I have this idea for how I can add colored threads to the loom.  But I need to dye some wool first.  Unfortunately, I've been too busy lately to prepare the dye myself.
	
		JOEL
	No problem!  I can do it for you.
	
		GWEN
	Really?  You'd do that?
	
		JOEL		
	Sure.  Just tell me what you need.
	
		GWEN
	Well, I'd need RED BERRIES and BLUE FLOWERS.  If you can bring those to me, I can do the rest.
	
		JOEL
	Consider it done.  I'll be back in a flash.


	
EXT. MARY'S WEAVER SHOP - DAY

JOEL looks around considering his options.

		JOEL
		(aside)
	Let's see, I think I can find RED BERRIES in the forest.  And I think I saw BLUE FLOWERS in the pasture.
	


EXT. REDTHORN SQUARE - DAY

As JOEL crosses the square, a group of GUARDS from Oak Manor enter.  They spread out and start collecting supplies from shopkeepers.  A few stay with a large wagon in the middle of the square.  Among them is RALPH, a large, young goat who is a rising member of the guards.  The wagon blocks the way to the pasture.  JOEL approaches.

		JOEL
	Hey there!  I need to get past.
	
		RALPH
	Oh do you, now?  And why exactly is that?
	
		JOEL
	No business of yours, Ralph.
	
RALPH walks over to JOEL and shoves him to the ground, holds his neck to the ground with the shafe of a spear.  The other guards watch.

		RALPH
	I'd not be using that tone of voice with the crimson guard.  Now what could be in be in the forest that is so important that you're interrupting the Lord Wither's official business?
	
		JOEL
	I'm going to the meadow to gather more sheep for shearing.
	
		RALPH
	Really?  I don't believe you.
	
		JOEL
	Grr.  If you must know, I'm fetching some RED BERRIES for GWEN.  She needs them to prepare a dye
	
RALPH smirks, then gets up.  He waves to a guard.

		RALPH
	Let him through.
	
JOEL gets to his feet, dusts himself off.

		JOEL
	How generous of you.
	
		RALPH
	What can I say?  If I don't give you the afternoon to pick all the lice off your sheep, you won't be able to sell a single bale of wool.  And then you'd get even scrawnier then you are now.  You'd shrivel up and blow away.
	
		JOEL
	You've always been a prick, Ralph, but ever since you joined the crimson guard, you've outdone yourself.
	
		RALPH
	Ha ha ha.
	
JOEL glares, then exits to meadow.



EXT. MEADOW - DAY

There are plenty of sheep in the meadow, but no berries.  A path leads a short way up the side of the mountian.   At the top are some RED BERRIES.  JOEL fights monsters, gets berries.



EXT. MARY'S WEAVER SHOP - DAY

JOEL enters, carrying RED BERRIES.  RALPH is already there talking to GWEN at the door of the shop.  RALPH also carries RED BERRIES.  RALPH and GWEN do not notice JOEL.

		JOEL
	What the...
	
		RALPH
	And I have a present for you.
	
		GWEN
	Red Berries!  How did you know?
	
		RALPH
	Oh, a little bird told me.
	
		GWEN
	Well, that's very sweet of you.  Now I can make that new fabric I've been thinking of.
	
GWEN notices JOEL

		GWEN
	Oh, hi Joel!
	
		RALPH
	Did I say bird?  I meant worm.
	
		JOEL
	That's it!  What are you doing here?
	
		RALPH
	My.  The mouse roars.
	
		JOEL
	I've had it with you.  You're a coward always hiding behind your badge of the Crimson Guard.
	
		RALPH
	Think you can take me, pipsqueek?  Fine, we'll do this man to man.
	
		GWEN
	Now boys...
	
		JOEL
	Bring it!
	
RALPH and JOEL fight.  RALPH wins, JOEL is knocked flat.

		RALPH
	Face it.  You're just not good enough.  Do you need any further protection from this ruffian, my lady?
	
		GWEN
	N... No...
	
		RALPH
	Then I must take my leave.  Farewell!  See you at the moon festival.
	
RALPH leaves.  GWEN walks over to JOEL, tends to him.

		GWEN
	Now why did you do that?
	
		JOEL
	I don't know.  That pompus jerk needs to be put in his place.
	
		GWEN
	That pompus jerk could kill you.  Or send you to the Lord's dungeon.  You have to learn to hold your tongue.
	
		JOEL
	Hmm.
	
		GWEN
	It's getting late.  I appreciate everything you've done.  Now why don't you go home and get some rest.  Festival day is tomorrow.
	
		JOEL
	Yes.  Goodnight, Gwen.
	
		GWEN
	Goodnight.



EXT. SHEEP BARN - NIGHT

JOEL returns home and goes to sleep.
	


EXT. SHEEP BARN - DAY

The wool cart stands packed and ready to go infront of the barn.  ALAN stands with arms folded, gazing at it.  JOEL enters.

		JOEL
	Good morning, uncle.
	
		ALAN
	Good morning, yerself.
	
		JOEL
	Is something wrong?
	
		ALAN
	I think my eyes must be playing tricks on me.  I could swear that I'm looking at my bales of wool stacked in a cart and sittin' in front of the barn.  But I know it canna be so, since my nephew shipped them to Dairy on last night's cargo train.
	
		JOEL
	Uh... Now uncle...
	
		ALAN
	Now uncle y'self!  Don't think I don't know you were trompin' o'er the mountain side last light like a March hare.  Collectin' trinkets for that lass.
	
		JOEL
	I can explain.
	
		ALAN
	I don't want you to explain anthing!  I want you to get these bales to the dock before the morining train.  Or you'll be driving them to Dairy yourself instead of makin' a fool of yourself at the festival.
	
		JOEL
	Yes sir.  Right away!
	
ALAN storms off.  JOEL hitches a horse to the wagon and heads for the center of town.
	


EXT. REDTHORN SQUARE - DAY

The square is bustling with last minute preparations for the evening's moon festival.  JOEL enters square.  MARY and GWEN are setting up a stall displaying their fanciest weavings.

		MARY
	Good morning, Joel!
	
		JOEL
	Good morning, Mary!  I'd love to stop and chat, but my uncle will have my hide if I don't have these bales to the dock in time for the morning train.
	
		MARY
	I would'nt want ya catchin' his wrath for my sake.  But I was hoping you could pick up a shipment for me on your way back.  It should be commin' in on the train.
	
		JOEL
	That I'd be glad to do.  What should I look for?
	
		MARY
	Some large crates with replacement parts for the loom.  Oh, and a small box made of cedar.  Gwen, dear, why don't you go with Joel and help him pick it out?  I'll finish up here.
	
		GWEN
	Yes mum.
	
GWEN joins JOEL at the cart and they both walk down to docks.



EXT. REDTHORN DOCKS - DAY

A canal is cut through the hills just outside of Redthorn.  Numerous crates are scattered about the dock and inside the nearby trainhouse.  A boat train is anchored at the dock and preparing to leave.  GREG gruffly regards a clipboard containing the day's manifest.

		JOEL
	Wait, wait!  One more!
	
		GREG
	Ha!  I was wondering if you'd make it.
	
		JOEL
	You're a saint, keeping them here.  I knew I could count on you, Gregory, old friend.
	
		GREG
	Ah, quit your yapping and get them loaded.  Everything's running a bit slow today, what with the moon festival and all.  Here, I'll give you a hand.
	
JOEL and GREG toss bales onto the boat train.
	
		GWEN
	Did something arrive for me?
	
		GREG
	Hmm.  Yes, indeed.  Wait here a second.
	
GREG disappears into train house.  He returns a few moments later with a small red box.

		GREG
	Here you are.
	
		JOEL
	What have you got there?
	
		GWEN
	I can't show you here.  Maybe later.  I should get back to town.  Mary will need me to help with the customers.
	
GWEN walks back to the town square.  JOEL and GREG finish loading bales.  JOEL returns to town.



EXT. REDTHORN SQUARE - DAY

More vendors are in the square and more decorations festoon the street.  Most of the setup work is done and many villagers are enjoying the music and food.  MARY is alone in her stall.

		JOEL
	I've got your crates, Mary.
	
		MARY
	Ah, you're a saint.  Could you be kind enough as to drop them at my shop?  Gwen will be there gathering up the last few weavings.
	
		JOEL
	That I will do.
	
	

INT. MARY'S WEAVER SHOP - DAY

The shop is quiet.  There are no customers and the street is vacant.  GWEN is in the back of the shop, sorting through bolts of cloth.

		JOEL
	Hello?  Anybody here?

		GWEN
	Yes, I'm in the back.
	
		JOEL
	Where should I leave the crates?
	
		GWEN
	Outside is fine.  There's not enough room to bring them in here.
	
JOEL walks over to where GWEN is standing.
	
		JOEL
	So what's the big secret in the box?
	
		GWEN
		(smiles)
	Let me show you.
	
GWEN opens box, revealing metal threads.

		JOEL
	Threads made of silver and gold!
	
		GWEN
	I have some new ideas for my weavings.  I heard that they made thread such as this in Ardolm and wanted to try it.  I've been waiting months for it.
	
		JOEL
	I can't wait so see what you make with it.  Your weavings are amazing.  Even better than any they have in Ardolm.
	
		GWEN
	Oh Joel.
	
		JOEL
	It's the truth!
	
		GWEN
	Flaterer.
	
		JOEL
	Say, Gwen, what would you say to a boat ride with me tonight?
	
		GWEN
	A boat ride?
	
		JOEL
	On lake Ibard.  Just you and me on a little rowboat drifting on the lake, under the light of the full moon, and the music of the festival drifting up from below.
	
		GWEN
	I think that would be romantic.
	
		JOEL
	So you'll do it?
	
		GWEN
	I'll be there.  When they start pulling the bell in the parish steeple.
	
GWEN gives JOEL a kiss on the cheek, then scoops up some tapestries.

		GWEN
	But 'til then I'm busy as a bee.  See you tonight!
	
GWEN leaves.  JOEL leaps into the air

		JOEL
	Yahoo!
	
JOEL exits shop.
	
		

EXT. REDTHORN SQUARE - DAY

The early festivities are interrupted as a squadron of the Crimson Guard enters.  A few guards head for food stalls, but most including RALPH head for Mary's stall.

		MARY
	Good day, gentelmen.  What can I do for you?
	
		RALPH
	Good day.  Would you know where Gwen is?
	
		MARY
	And what ye be wantin' with her?
	
		RALPH
		(grins)
	It's nothing like that.  I'm here on official business.  The lord wishes to see her.
	
		MARY
	Lord Sargon?  Ye be tellin' the truth?
	
GWEN enters the square, aproaches stall.

		GWEN
	What's going on here?
	
		RALPH
	Ah - there you are.
	
		MARY
	Ralph here says you've been summoned to Lord Sargon's castle.
	
		GWEN
	Summoned?  Maybe he wants to comission a tapestry!  Wouldn't that be magnificent?
	
		MARY
	Aye, it would.
	
		RALPH
	Well, then.  Let's not keep his lordship waiting.
	
		GWEN
	Will I be back in time for the festival?
	
		RALPH
	I wouldn't worry about that.  His lordship has a pretty good idea of everything that goes on in the village.
	
RALPH, GWEN and GUARDS exit village, heading for Oak Manor.  



EXT. IBARD LAKE - NIGHT

JOEL sits alone near a rowboat on the short of Ibard lake.  Far below in village revelers shout and dance.

		JOEL
	I don't understand.  Where could she be?  Maybe she didn't want to come after all.
	
JOEL hears a rustling in nearby bushes.  Hopeful that it's Gwen, he goes to investigate.  A clay creature leaps out at him.  They fight.

		JOEL
	What was that thing?  Did it attack Gwen?  Maybe she's lying on the path somewhere!
	
JOEL rushes down path to village, fighting monsters.



EXT. REDTHORN SQUARE - NIGHT

Many revelers, including a few of the Crimson Guard clog the square.  JOEL searches the square and comes across MARY.

		JOEL
	Ah, Mary, thank goodness I've found you.  Do you know where Gwen is?
	
		MARY
	I've not seen her since this morning.  I expect she's still up at the manor.
	
		JOEL
	The manor?

		MARY
	Did you not hear?  The Lord Phillip summoned her there this afternoon.
	
		JOEL
	He did?
	
		MARY
	Aye.  But I did expect she'd be back before sunset.  I was hoping she might be with you.
	
		JOEL
	No, I've not seen her.
	
		MARY
	Ah, we're fretting about nothing.  She's likely having the time of her life inside the manor.  They don't allow too many of us common folk in there.
	
		JOEL
	Hmm...
	
SFX: WOOD CRACKING, BREAKING

Suddenly a stone lion bursts into the square, crashing into and overturning a cart.  It then turns and jumps at MARY, the closest person to it.  JOEL rushes to defend her, fights lion.

		JOEL
	What was that?
	
		MARY
	I don't know, but it looks like it came from the manor!
	
		JOEL
	I'm going up there.  Gwen might be in trouble!
	
		MARY
	Oh, do be safe JOEL.  Here, I don't have much, but you might as well take these potions I have.
	
		JOEL
	Thanks Mary.
	
JOEL rushes from the square, and up the path to Oak Manor.



EXT. ROAD TO OAK MANOR - NIGHT

GUARDS lie scattered to either side of the road, apparently tossed asside by the stone beast.  They no longer block the path to the manor.  JOEL rushes up the path to the manor.



EXT. OAK MANOR - NIGHT

		JOEL
		(to himself)
	I have to see if Gwen is all right.

JOEL searches the gounds.  He sees an apparition of Gwen on a balcony which vanishes.  He climbs a vine to the balcony and enters the manor.


-------------------

- Finds boy in kitchen.  Son of guy in town.  Recruits as ally
- Reanimation lab in cellar of manor
- Gwen in trance, acting under magical influence
- Lord Sargon extracting her magical powers
- 

	
		
		
		
// Most of the young men in the village have gone to work in the mud mine.  Here mud which is supposed to have rejuvinating qualities is mined for the lord.  It has overtaken wool as a revenue source.  

//Many of the miners are cut off from family.  The lord also drains their life energy to create golems.

// A shipment of golems is provided for the town at harvest time.  These come to life and wreak havok.

// Can run into mad doctor in disguise at train station.

---
Doctor exctracts energy from miners under guise of treating them at the infirmary.  Miners that have special treatment emerge with diminished mental abilities, enhanced physical.

Sargon's workers are regular miners.  A few of them discovered a special mineral.  The doctor recognized it as a passage to another dimension.  The workers were silenced after a visit to the infirmary.  

Sargon became aware of Gwen by studying astrology charts.  Her natural brilliance and magical abilities confirmed her uniqueness.  Has abducted her and is preparing to use her to open portal during lunar eclipse.

Gwen's supernatural appearances and miricales are an effect of her resisting Sargon's trance.

Lord Sargon wishes to merge his life essence with the body of an immortal beast drawn forth from the holy land.

The Red Guard are merging their bodies with terrestrial beasts (the don't know  of the holy land).  They use a variation of the process that is used on the miners to become super soldiers.  Sargon demands loyalty in return and is preparing to raise an unstoppable army.

Many beasts in manor.  Some are guard beasts, most are being used for extraction.

Joel runs into Ralph.  They fight, Ralph capturse Joel and takes him to laboratory.  In lab, doctor prepares to reduce Joel, explains plan.  Doctor leaves.  Doctor's assistant has a crisis of concience and releases Joel on the condition that he rescue Gwen and prevent door to holy land from opening.  

(Most of mansion is sidequests for armor.)

Ralph runs to secret mine as moon eclipses.  Sargon and doctor are preparing machine, Gwen to open portal.  Joel fights doctor.  Doctor falls off mountainside.  Machine activates, drawing energy from Gwen, opening portal.  Sargon speaks about the fleetingness of life and how he will have immortality.  Beast emerges through portal and merges with Sargon.  Gwen revives from trance and uses last of her energy to blast beast.  Weakend, Joel is able to drive it back into the holy land.

Joel carries Gwen back to Mary's shop where she recovers.  She is less powerful now, but much in love with Joel.  Game closes with Joel and Gwen rowing on Ibard lake under the waning moon.
