        <h1>Paint Layout Tool</h1>

        <p>
        All paints have a layout that affects how they are displayed.
        The paint layout can stretch, rotate and otherwise change how
        the paint is drawn on-screen.  This tool provides an easy
        way to manipulate the paint layout.</p>

        <p>Some paints (such as flat colors) will not be visibly
            altered by their paint layout.</p>

        <p>There are three different sub-tools for laying out paints.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Linear paint layout provides a simple line along which a
            linear gradient can be spread.</li>
            <li>Radial paint layout makes laying out radial
                grandients easy.  You can also set the gradient
                focus by holding &lt;Ctrl&gt; while clicking and dragging.</li>
            <li>Texture paint layout is the easiest way to layout
            textures by manipulating the shape of the box a single
            texture unit will fill.</li>
        </ul>
