        <h1>Paint Layout Tool</h1>

        <p>
        All paints have a layout that affects how they are displayed.
        The paint layout can stretch, rotate and otherwise change how
        the paint is drawn on-screen.  This tool provides an easy
        way to manipulate the paint layout.</p>

        <p>Some paints (such as flat colors) will not be visibly
            altered by their paint layout.</p>

        <p>There are three different sub-tools for laying out paints:</p>

        <h3>Linear Paint Layout</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Provides a simple line that defines the start and end points
                of a linear gradient.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Radial Paint Layout</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>A more complex control that lets you position the center,
            radii and focus of a radial paint.</li>
            <li>Pressing &lt;ctrl&gt; and dragging will let you position
            the focus point even if it is hidden by the other drag handles.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Texture Paint Layout</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Lets you position a texture fill by manipulating the
            bounding quad of a single texture unit.</li>
        </ul>
