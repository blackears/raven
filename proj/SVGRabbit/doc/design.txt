-Use a stack to draw images.  Start at root and draw in depth first order.
-<use> and other reference tags can just add their target onto the draw stack
when encountered.
-Scene graph renders to a surface.  The root has a surface, and every node with
a filter also has a surface target.  An <image> can also be interpreted as a
static surface.  Each surface is backed by an image buffer and treated as an
image by whatever is below it.
-Most renderers will cache surfaces and paths on a per-node basis and clear
them when their shape structure changes.
